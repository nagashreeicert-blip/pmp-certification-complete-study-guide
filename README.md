# PMP Certification Overview

## PMP Helps You Grow Faster in Your Career

Many people already manage projects without the official title.  
You talk to clients, guide your team, handle issues, adjust timelines, and solve problems every day.  
But without a **PMP certification**, companies may not consider you a real Project Manager.

With PMP, you can get:  
- Higher salary  
- Faster promotions  
- More respect in your company  
- Better job roles  
- Strong resume value  

Most companies use ATS (resume filter software).  
If “PMP” is missing, your resume may get rejected.  
**PMP makes you stand out immediately.**
